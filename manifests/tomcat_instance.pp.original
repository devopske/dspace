# Definition: dspace::tomcat_instance
#
# Installs an Apache Tomcat instance (prerequisite for DSpace) with the
# given parameters, using the following Puppet Tomcat module (or a compatible one)
# https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tomcat/
#
# WARNING: puppetlabs-tomcat must already be installed/available to Puppet
# for this to work!
#
# Optionally, you can also choose to install Tomcat via other means
# (manually or write your own puppet script). In this situation, this script
# may provide a good starting point.
#
# Tested on:
# - Ubuntu 16.04
#
# Parameters:
# - $package        => Tomcat package to install/use (e.g. 'tomcat7', 'tomcat8', etc)
# - $owner          => OS account which should own Tomcat (i.e. who Tomcat should run as). Default=name of package (e.g. tomcat8)
# - $group          => OS group which should own Tomcat (default is same as $owner)
# - $service        => Name of the default Tomcat service (default is same as $package)
# - $catalina_home  => Full path to Catalina Home (default=/usr/share/$package), i.e. installation directory
# - $catalina_base  => Full path to Catalina Base (default=/var/lib/$package), i.e. instance directory
# - $app_base       => Directory where Tomcat instance should load webapps (default=$name)
# - $port           => Port this Tomcat instance runs on
# - $ajp_port       => AJP port for Tomcat redirects. Only useful to set if using Apache webserver + Tomcat (see apache_site.pp)
# - $catalina_opts  => Options to pass to Tomcat (default='-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Xmx2048m -Xms1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC')
# - $ensure         => Whether to install (ensure=present) or remove (ensure=absent) this Tomcat instance (default=present)
#
# Sample Usage:
# dspace::tomcat_instance {
#    package    => 'tomcat8',
# }
